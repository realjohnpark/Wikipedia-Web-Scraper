# Wikipedia-Web-Scraper

This is a Python Web Scraper that takes Wikipedia pages as input. It will parse through the page and give back headers, subheaders, the most frequent words of the main sections, and the hyperlinks associated with each section/subsection.

NOTE: Section numbers being incremented up by 1 when a table of contents is present is an intentional design decision. However, if you want to make the section numbers match the headings, my program can be easily modified to combine the introductory section and the table of contents together. Please contact me if you would like me to make this change.

Please input the following into your command prompt before running the program to install all required modules:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the program through Python IDLE or an environment of your choosing.
